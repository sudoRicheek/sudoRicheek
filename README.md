I am currently a First-year [CIS](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/) PhD student at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/). I specialize in understanding and working with different sensing modalities. This requires me to work in pretty diverse fields: Computer Vision, NLU, 3D Vision, Causal Inference, Compressed Sensing, Human-Computer Interaction, and more... I keep on trying to decide on a sub-domain to focus on, but problems with real-world applications of AI/Stats are too many to ignore! So for now, I'll continue to pretend that I work on <b>Interdisciplinary AI :)</b> 

I always look for exciting research opportunities, so do drop by if you want to discuss!
