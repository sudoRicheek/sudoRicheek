I am currently a Senior [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/) undergrad at the [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/). I research AI and statistics in pretty diverse fields: Computer Vision, NLU, Causal Inference, Compressed Sensing, Behavioural Economics, and more... I keep on trying to decide on a sub-domain to focus on, but problems with real-world applications of AI/Stats are too many to ignore. So for now I'll continue to pretend that I work on <b>Interdisciplinary AI :)</b> 

I am always on the lookout for exciting research opportunities, so do drop by if you want to have a discussion!
