I am currently majoring in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/) from the [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/). My research interests are somewhat in the intersection of Image Processing, Compressed Sensing, Theoretical Deep Learning and Causal Statistics. Recently, I have been enjoying reading about the interesting design decisions in Graph Neural Networks! I am always on the lookout for exciting research, so do drop by if you want to have a discussion!
