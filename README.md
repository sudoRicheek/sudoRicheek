I am a third-year Computer Science PhD student at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/), working with Prof. Pratik Chaudhari in the [GRASP Laboratory](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu). Broadly, I work on Event-based Vision, Self-Supervised Representation Learning, Robotic Perception, and Multimodal Sensing.

I am always looking for exciting research opportunities, so do drop by if you want to discuss!
